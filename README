simple_spheres
**************

    A very basic, fairly fast
    multithreaded raytracer written in C.
    
    I'm using it mainly as a demo and testbed.
    
    It can render the canonical shiny balls -- eight of them,
    bouncing around in an invisible box, with two point
    light sources and a trace depth of two (ie you can see
    reflections of reflections) -- at 45fps in my little VM
    running on my laptop at VGA resolution. It cheats 
    egregiously to make this possible, starting by rasterizing
    the spheres very crudely into a stencil buffer, and then
    only tracing rays in places where the stencil buffer is
    set.

    In the future, I want to experiment with a more general form
    of this: I want to use OpenGL to render a scene up the the
    fragment stage, and then go through the fragments, tracing 
    secondary rays from only the (usually small) subset that are
    highly specular. I am wondering whether this can be implemented
    directly on the GPU as a shader. 
    
    Simple_spheres is fairly badass.
